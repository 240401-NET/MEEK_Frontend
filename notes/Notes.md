## Make sure to npm install everytime you are cloning or pulling from the repo!
- all dependencies are tracked in package.json but that doesn't mean you have those dependencies installed in your local system

## When first downloading front end project:
- cd into vite-project folder
    - run npm install - to install all dependencies for the project
- npm run build to compile and build project
- npm run dev to view project on local hosted website;
    - allows for viewing changes dynamically

## Implementing a new feature:
- git pull
- git checkout -b nameOfMybranch
- --do coding work
- git add {dir,files, or all}
- git commit -m "commit message"
- git push --set-upstream origin nameOfMybranch

- To get back to main:
- git checkout main
